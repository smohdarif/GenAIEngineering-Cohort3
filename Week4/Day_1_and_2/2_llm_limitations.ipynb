      "### SQL Database\n",
      "If you are using a SQL database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, you can use a query like this:\n",

      "1. **Inventory Management Software**: If you use inventory management software (e.g., QuickBooks, Zoho Inventory, Fishbowl Inventory), log in to the system and search for product ID 12345. The software should display the current inventory count.\n",

      "2. **ERP System**: If you use an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, navigate to the inventory module and search for the product ID. The system will show you the current stock levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Spreadsheet**: If you maintain inventory in a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets), open the file and search for product ID 12345. The inventory count should be listed in the corresponding row or column.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Warehouse Management System (WMS)**: If you use a WMS, log in and search for the product ID to get the current inventory count.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Database Query**: If you have access to the database, you can run a query to count the number of active users. For example, in SQL, you might use a query like:\n",

      "   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE last_active_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "If you have access to a database or a spreadsheet with transaction data, you can use formulas to automate this process. For example, in Excel, you can use the `AVERAGE` function to calculate the average transaction value directly.\n",

      "User: My favorite programming language is Python.\n",
      "Assistant: That's great! Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its readability and ease of use. Whether you're interested in web development, data science, automation, or any other field, Python has a lot to offer. Here are a few resources and tips to help you get the most out of Python:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Learning Resources\n",
      "1. **Official Documentation**: The [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is an excellent resource for understanding the language in depth.\n",

      "3. **Validate all user input**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly update your software dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. This includes updating your Docker images as mentioned in Document 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use secure coding practices**: Follow secure coding guidelines specific to the programming language you are using. For example, avoid using insecure functions and follow best practices for error handling and input validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Use secure configurations**: Configure your applications and servers securely. For example, don't run containers as root (Document 5) and use secure configurations for your database and web server.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Implement proper access controls**: Ensure that users have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Use role-based access control (RBAC) and principle of least privilege.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Regularly review and test your code**: Conduct regular security reviews and testing, including static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST).\n",
