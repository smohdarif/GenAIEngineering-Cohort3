## 4. Testing and QA Phases Integration

### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Testing:** To be conducted after each sprint to ensure component functionality.
- **Integration Testing:** Conducted after the development of related features.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Involve selected users to provide feedback on the final product.

---

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Plan:
- Use CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Initial deployment to staging for final validation before moving to production.
- Monitoring tools to ensure application performance and users' feedback post-launch.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment and Contingency Plans

### Identified Risks:
- Delays in API integration.
- Feature creep affecting timelines.
- Underestimating testing requirements.

### Contingency Plans:
- Regular check-ins and adjustments in scope.
- Allocate additional resources for critical paths.
- Maintain a prioritized backlog for features.

## 8. Dependency Mapping and Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Dependencies:
- User Authentication relies on secure API call structures.
- Personalized News Feed depends on external news API integrations.
  
### Critical Path:
- Ensure that essential features such as user authentication are completed first to allow later components to function correctly.

---

## 9. Success Criteria for Each Milestone

- Features must meet acceptance criteria as per user stories.
- Successful completion of testing with a threshold of less than 5 critical bugs before go-live.
- Validated user feedback from UAT sessions.

---

## 10. Go-Live Checklist and Post-Launch Support

### Go-Live Checklist:
- Finalize features and testing.
- Ensure documentation is up-to-date.
- Communication to stakeholders about launch date and new features.

### Post-Launch Support:
- Implement a support channel for user feedback and issues.
- Monitor system performance and user analytics for continuous improvement.
