    "\n",
    "The code performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Required Modules**:\n",
    "    - `os`: Provides functions to interact with the operating system.\n",
    "    - `load_dotenv` from `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the system environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Environment Variables**:\n",
    "    - The `load_dotenv()` function is called to load environment variables from a `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clearing Conflicting Environment Variables**:\n",
    "    - A list of environment variables (`env_vars_to_clear`) is defined, which includes `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and `OPENAI_API_BASE`.\n",
    "    - For each variable in the list, the code checks if it exists in the environment. If it does, it prints a warning message and deletes the variable from the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Setting New Environment Variables**:\n",
    "    - The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to the value of the `OPEN_ROUTER_KEY` environment variable.\n",
    "    - Both `OPENAI_API_BASE` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` are set to `'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Commented-Out Code**:\n",
    "    - There is an alternative block of code (commented out) that clears the same environment variables and sets `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the value of the `OPEN_AI_KEY` environment variable instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This code ensures that conflicting environment variables are removed and sets up the required environment variables for interacting with the OpenRouter API. It provides flexibility to switch between different API keys and base URLs by modifying the `.env` file or uncommenting the alternative block of code.\n"
