# Git attributes to help preserve your work during merges
# Files marked with "ours" merge strategy will keep your version during conflicts

# If you have personal notebooks or files you want to always keep your version:
# my_personal_notebook.ipynb merge=ours
# my_work_folder/** merge=ours

# Example: Uncomment and modify these if you have specific files to protect
# Week5/my_work.ipynb merge=ours
# my_custom_changes.py merge=ours

# Note: Be careful with merge=ours - it will always keep your version
# even if upstream has important updates. Use selectively!
